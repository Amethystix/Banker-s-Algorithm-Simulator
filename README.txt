Lab 3 for Operating Systems by Lauren DiGiovanni :)
Contained in this zip archive, you will find 3 java files:
LabThreeMain.java
Process.java
Instruction.java

This lab's purpose is to provide a simulation of both the 
pessimistic banker's algorithm in preventing deadlock, as well
as the more optimistic FIFO method in hopefully
avoiding deadlock.

To compile these files, first open your command line and
change the directory to the location of these files.

Next, type into your command line:
javac LabThreeMain.java

After it compiles, then type in:
java LabThreeMain argument.txt

With the argument being a text file representing the input
for the lab. The results will be printed to the console :)
