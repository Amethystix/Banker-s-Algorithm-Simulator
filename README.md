# Banker-s-Algorithm-Simulator
A project for my Operating Systems  class to simulate deadlock prevention using an optimistic and pessimistic resource manager
The text file version of the README file contains my original comments on the project, which are just how to run the project, a required portion of our grade.  It also gives a brief description of the lab.
